🚀 Built a Real-Time Facial Recognition Attendance System Using Deep Learning

I’m excited to share a project I developed—a Facial Recognition Attendance System designed to automate attendance tracking with real-time face recognition. 🖥️📸

💡 Project Overview:
This system uses deep learning models to detect and recognize faces, making attendance marking fast, reliable, and secure. It automates the entire process, reducing manual errors and ensuring accuracy.

🔑 Key Features:
Facial Recognition Using Deep Learning:
The system uses MTCNN for face detection and Inception ResNet V1 to generate 128D face embeddings, allowing for accurate recognition of registered individuals.
Real-Time Attendance:
Attendance is captured in real-time via a webcam, and the system automatically updates the attendance in an Excel file.
Automated Registration:
New users can be easily registered by capturing multiple facial angles and storing their facial features.
Multi-Mode Input:

Attendance can be taken via file upload, live camera feed, or an IP camera, providing flexibility in operation.
Attendance Reports:
The system generates attendance reports and stores historical data, making it easy to review attendance.
Notifications via Telegram:

Telegram integration sends real-time notifications, informing admins when students are marked present.

🔧 Tech Stack:
MTCNN for face detection
Inception ResNet V1 for feature extraction
OpenCV for video processing
Tkinter for the GUI interface
Excel for storing attendance records
Telegram API for notifications

🚀 What I Learned:
Building a robust real-time facial recognition system using deep learning models.
Implementing automated attendance systems with multi-input options (camera, file, IP camera).
Developing user-friendly GUI interfaces for managing attendance.
Integrating Telegram for real-time updates and notifications.
